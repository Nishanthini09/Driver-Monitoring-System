# Driver Monitoring System using Computer Vision (ADAS)

This project implements a real-time **Driver Monitoring System** using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system detects signs of **driver drowsiness**, **head pose direction**, and **mobile phone usage**, aiming to improve road safety and serve as a prototype for ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems).

## üìå Project Objective

The goal of this system is to monitor a driver's attention level using a webcam. By combining facial landmark analysis, head pose estimation, and object detection, the system detects distracted driving behavior such as:

- Eye closure (drowsiness)
- Looking away from the road
- Using a mobile phone while driving

This can serve as a critical component of any driver safety or in-vehicle alert system.

## üéØ Features

### üëÅÔ∏è Drowsiness Detection
- Uses **MediaPipe FaceMesh** to extract facial landmarks.
- Calculates the **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** to determine if eyes are closed.
- Raises an alert if eyes remain closed for a threshold period.

### üß† Head Pose Estimation
- Estimates driver‚Äôs gaze direction (left, right, forward).
- Based on 3D landmark mapping and projection of nose direction.
- Useful to detect if driver is looking away from the road.

### üì± Phone Usage Detection
- Integrates a YOLOv5 object detection model to detect if the driver is holding a **cell phone**.
- Triggers a warning when a phone is detected in the frame.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/driver-monitoring-system.git
cd driver-monitoring-system
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
```

### 3. Install required dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download YOLOv5 Weights

Place the `yolov5s.pt` model in the project root.  
You can download it from [YOLOv5 GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases).

### 5. Run the system

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch your webcam and start monitoring.

## üìÑ .gitignore

To avoid uploading unnecessary files to GitHub, the following items are ignored:

```
__pycache__/
venv/
*.pt
*.pyc
.DS_Store
*.log
shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`. Typical libraries used:

- opencv-python
- numpy
- mediapipe
- torch
- torchvision
- yolov5 (add as submodule or directory)
- imutils

> You may need to install YOLOv5 manually or include it as a subdirectory clone.

## üîç Detection Logic

### Drowsiness Detection:
- Uses EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio)
- If EAR remains below threshold for X seconds ‚Üí Drowsiness alert

### Head Pose:
- 3D nose vector is projected to detect direction
- Direction: LEFT, RIGHT, FORWARD

### Phone Detection:
- YOLOv5 checks for `cell phone` label
- If confidence exceeds threshold ‚Üí Phone in use alert
